      This Assignment is my first assignment about web development. I feel it's interesting and not really hard. After I'm done with the coding stuff and see the page displayed, I feel satisfied and happy. A nice experience for me! During the process, I had a trouble with installing git on mac catellina, but finally I set up commind line tool in my mac to fix it. The rest part of this assignment went well for me and I didn't run into any problems. From this assignment, I learned how to code in html language. The syntax is also easy to understand. Before this assignment, I actually didn't know any stuff about web development, but after completing it, I know how to use html to design a web page's structure and content, how to insert images and hyperlinks inside a web page. I feel it's an interesting process to develop a vivid web page. Also, I think it's really helpful to listen to course lectures and use lecture notes as well as other resources published on course website for completing this assignment. I used them when I'm not sure about the syntax, and review some basic concepts. All in all, a great coding experience!

      This assignment is more complicated for me than assignment 1. I feel that styling a given html page correctly and concisly is not that easy as imagined; however, it's interesting as well. I faced some porblems while doing it. Making the web page lay out exactly as the mocks is challenging for me. I couldn't find the exact margin, padding, and width or height values. Also, considering the elements's display, position and distance between one another is not easy for me as well. I just solved these problems by visual inspection and search some examples online about how to lay out various containers in a page. From this assignment, I learned how to use css skills to lay out and style a web page. I find that I could firstly decide each element's display way, position, and then use 'box model' to precisly locate it, after that, I could decorate it with colors and other details. I also learned how to retouch an element with some css effects. Lecture notes and some online css tutorials like W3School were helpful for completing this assignment. I reviewd lecture notes before working on this assignment, and searching for tutorials in W3School website when I don't know how to accomplish some features. I googled how to make a title and an image in a line for header, how to make elements wrap naturaly in a page and some color names to complete the assignment.

         This assignment is some chanllenging for me. I think the most chanllenging part is to get the logical interaction set up correctly. It's not easy to design a process logically and clearly during the whole process. I got problems with creating new posts' condition field, filtering the condition of posts, combine all the filters together and refilterting all the posts some times. Finally I solved these problems. I figured out how to get the value of checked box by creating functions, and I restore all the posts information to an array to prepare for filtering, and I create a function to get the current posts on the page and set it to all the filter functions in order to avoid influences from previous filtering, it's like refreshing the posts. And I create a function to add all posts back in order to support refiltering for extra credits. However, I'm still not sure about how to add new cities to the filter. Before working on the assignment, I only know some basic JS fundemantals, DOM Manipulation, and JS Events by reviewing lecture notes and listening to lectures. Actually I find it's helpful to review these lecture notes before coding because I could get an overall knowledge and understanding of JS. After comleting this assignment, I think I know how to apply these theories to implementation. I really feel the importance of functions. I know more detailed application of JS elements, and I know how to select DOM elements efficiently. By the way, I feel debugging logic errors is tough. Resourses like lecture notes and W3School JS tutorials online are good resources for this assignment. In addtion, I also googled some questions about this assignment, such as how to get checked box value, more info about string in JS and array in JS etc. All in all, it's a great experience with coding in JavaScript.
