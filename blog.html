      This Assignment is my first assignment about web development. I feel it's interesting and not really hard. After I'm done with the coding stuff and see the page displayed, I feel satisfied and happy. A nice experience for me! During the process, I had a trouble with installing git on mac catellina, but finally I set up commind line tool in my mac to fix it. The rest part of this assignment went well for me and I didn't run into any problems. From this assignment, I learned how to code in html language. The syntax is also easy to understand. Before this assignment, I actually didn't know any stuff about web development, but after completing it, I know how to use html to design a web page's structure and content, how to insert images and hyperlinks inside a web page. I feel it's an interesting process to develop a vivid web page. Also, I think it's really helpful to listen to course lectures and use lecture notes as well as other resources published on course website for completing this assignment. I used them when I'm not sure about the syntax, and review some basic concepts. All in all, a great coding experience!

      This assignment is more complicated for me than assignment 1. I feel that styling a given html page correctly and concisly is not that easy as imagined; however, it's interesting as well. I faced some porblems while doing it. Making the web page lay out exactly as the mocks is challenging for me. I couldn't find the exact margin, padding, and width or height values. Also, considering the elements's display, position and distance between one another is not easy for me as well. I just solved these problems by visual inspection and search some examples online about how to lay out various containers in a page. From this assignment, I learned how to use css skills to lay out and style a web page. I find that I could firstly decide each element's display way, position, and then use 'box model' to precisly locate it, after that, I could decorate it with colors and other details. I also learned how to retouch an element with some css effects. Lecture notes and some online css tutorials like W3School were helpful for completing this assignment. I reviewd lecture notes before working on this assignment, and searching for tutorials in W3School website when I don't know how to accomplish some features. I googled how to make a title and an image in a line for header, how to make elements wrap naturaly in a page and some color names to complete the assignment.
