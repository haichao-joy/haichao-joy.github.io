      This Assignment is my first assignment about web development. I feel it's interesting and not really hard. After I'm done with the coding stuff and see the page displayed, I feel satisfied and happy. A nice experience for me! During the process, I had a trouble with installing git on mac catellina, but finally I set up commind line tool in my mac to fix it. The rest part of this assignment went well for me and I didn't run into any problems. From this assignment, I learned how to code in html language. The syntax is also easy to understand. Before this assignment, I actually didn't know any stuff about web development, but after completing it, I know how to use html to design a web page's structure and content, how to insert images and hyperlinks inside a web page. I feel it's an interesting process to develop a vivid web page. Also, I think it's really helpful to listen to course lectures and use lecture notes as well as other resources published on course website for completing this assignment. I used them when I'm not sure about the syntax, and review some basic concepts. All in all, a great coding experience!
